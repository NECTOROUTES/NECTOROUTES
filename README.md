### ***Closing the education resource delivery gap***
## **Our Story**
*Stency and Solomon are two of the four children in a single mother parented home that were able to exhibit exceptional abilities to secure education in 2 different private schools that provide a better education away from home problems. At the peak of March, 2020 when schools were closed in Uganda, these 2 underprivileged children lost hope of ever getting to study again. 

They had no access to educational resources that they could use to keep up with school work. After one and half a year, their schools introduced programs of providing educational materials within their homes that must be fetched by a parent or guardian on a weekly basis and as well be returned back after completion of exercises to get more. The challenge is that the schools are hundreds of kilometers away from their home and their mother being unemployed in this pandemic, has made it difficult to break off from the daily hardships she takes to secure a meal on the table.*
