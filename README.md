# Create and deploy a Node.js + Cloudant application

In this sample application, you will create a basic web application using Express to serve web pages in Node.js integrated complete with standard best practices, including a health check and application metric monitoring. In addition, this sample includes integration with Cloudant, a fully managed JSON document database.

You can access the cloud native microservice capabilities at the following endpoints:
- Health endpoint: `/health`

## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/nodejs-+-cloudant) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first. Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` endpoint to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

</p>

Click **Deploy to IBM Cloud** to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud. This option creates a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted GitLab project and a DevOps toolchain. You can deploy your app to Cloud Foundry, a Kubernetes cluster, or a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. OpenShift is available only through a standard cluster, which requires you to have a billable account.

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud.

### Building locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.

#### Native application development

- Install the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 14+ LTS version.

Once the Node toolchain has been installed, you can download the project dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

To run your application locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.  You can access the `/health` endpoint at the host. You can also verify the state of your locally running application using the Selenium UI test script included in the `scripts` directory.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started) on your machine by running the following command:
```
curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
```

Create an application on IBM Cloud by running:

```bash
ibmcloud dev create
```

This will create and download a starter application with the necessary files needed for local development and deployment.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch your application locally. When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud on Cloud Foundry or Kubernetes, run one of the following commands:

```bash
ibmcloud dev deploy -t buildpack // to Cloud Foundry
ibmcloud dev deploy -t container // to K8s cluster
```

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```

## Testing, linting, and code coverage

### Running tests and code coverage

To run tests and code coverage, run `npm run test`. A `coverage` folder will be created with code coverage results that can be reviewed for gaps. The code coverage thresholds are also defined in `package.json` under `nyc` and can be adjusted if needed. Also, you can use the script `npm run fix` to automatically fix linting problems.

### Pre-commit hooks

By default, a [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) pre-commit hook is defined in `package.json`, which runs linting, testing, and code coverage before the commit is made. If either the linting, testing, or code coverage fails, the pre-commit hook prevents the changes from being committed. Review the results and fix the problems, or modify the thresholds to allow the commit to succeed.
